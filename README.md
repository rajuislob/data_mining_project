# Disease Classification Model Comparison

This project focuses on comparing the performance of various machine learning classification models on different disease datasets using data mining and knowledge discovery techniques. The goal is to analyze how different algorithms perform across diverse medical diagnosis tasks.

## Project Highlights
- Applied preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Implemented and compared models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM
- Evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visual comparisons using confusion matrices and ROC curves
